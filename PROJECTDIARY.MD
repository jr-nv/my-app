# Project Diary

## July 8, 2025 - Project Review and Documentation Update

### Project Overview
Today we conducted a thorough review of the Next.js project. The project is a modern web application built with the following tech stack:

- **Next.js** (v15.3.5) - React framework for production
- **TypeScript** (v5.8.3) - Static type checking
- **Tailwind CSS** (v4.1.11) - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Supabase** (v2.50.3) - Open source Firebase alternative

### Project Structure
The project follows a standard Next.js App Router structure:
- `src/` - Application source code
  - `app/` - Next.js App Router pages
  - `lib/` - Utility functions and shared libraries
    - `supabase.ts` - Supabase client configuration

### Accomplishments Today
1. **Documentation Improvement**:
   - Updated the README.md file to accurately reflect the project's tech stack with specific versions
   - Added detailed sections on project structure, available scripts, and development workflow
   - Clarified the Supabase integration and environment setup
   - Improved formatting and organization of the documentation

2. **Version Verification**:
   - Verified the exact versions of key dependencies:
     - Next.js: v15.3.5
     - TypeScript: v5.8.3 (updated from generic v5)
     - Tailwind CSS: v4.1.11 (updated from generic v4)
     - Supabase: v2.50.3

3. **Environment Configuration Review**:
   - Confirmed the existence of the `.env.local` file with Supabase credentials
   - Verified that the file is properly gitignored for security
   - Updated documentation to reflect the existing configuration
