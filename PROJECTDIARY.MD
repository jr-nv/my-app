# Project Diary

## July 8, 2025 - Project Review, Documentation Update, and Project Rules Setup

### Project Overview
Today we conducted a thorough review of the Next.js project. The project is a modern web application built with the following tech stack:

- **Next.js** (v15.3.5) - React framework for production
- **TypeScript** (v5.8.3) - Static type checking
- **Tailwind CSS** (v4.1.11) - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Supabase** (v2.50.3) - Open source Firebase alternative

### Project Structure
The project follows a standard Next.js App Router structure:
- `src/` - Application source code
  - `app/` - Next.js App Router pages
  - `lib/` - Utility functions and shared libraries
    - `supabase.ts` - Supabase client configuration

### Accomplishments Today
1. **Documentation Improvement**:
   - Updated the README.md file to accurately reflect the project's tech stack with specific versions
   - Added detailed sections on project structure, available scripts, and development workflow
   - Clarified the Supabase integration and environment setup
   - Improved formatting and organization of the documentation

2. **Version Verification**:
   - Verified the exact versions of key dependencies:
     - Next.js: v15.3.5
     - TypeScript: v5.8.3 (updated from generic v5)
     - Tailwind CSS: v4.1.11 (updated from generic v4)
     - Supabase: v2.50.3

3. **Environment Configuration Review**:
   - Confirmed the existence of the `.env.local` file with Supabase credentials
   - Verified that the file is properly gitignored for security
   - Updated documentation to reflect the existing configuration

4. **Project Rules and Standards**:
   - Created a comprehensive `workspace_rules.md` file defining project standards
   - Established coding conventions for TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS
   - Defined file organization structure and import ordering
   - Set up Supabase integration standards
   - Created documentation and maintenance guidelines

5. **Project Memory System**:
   - Created 12 project-specific memories to enforce consistent standards
   - Memories include tech stack requirements, code architecture, TypeScript standards, styling guidelines, and more
   - Tagged all memories with project-specific identifiers to ensure they only apply to this project

6. **GitHub Repository Update**:
   - Connected local repository to GitHub remote (https://github.com/jr-nv/my-app.git)
   - Committed all documentation updates, project rules, and code changes
   - Successfully pushed changes to the master branch
   - Repository now contains the latest documentation and project standards

### Next Steps
- Implement new features based on the established project standards
- Continue to maintain the project diary for all significant changes
- Leverage the project memory system to ensure consistent development practices
- Consider adding automated testing based on the quality assurance guidelines
